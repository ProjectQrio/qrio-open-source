Project Qrio is looking for funding, curious people to test the latest iteration, and passionate Web3 and Web2 developers to build with. 

tldr; Qrio is a social platform built with a system of incentives that, through micro contributions from individuals with different perspectives, will facilitate the best information on a particular topic being efficiently curated and displayed in a useful manner.

For a longer explanation read out "About" page at https://projectqrio.com/get-started

Project Qrio is entering its third phase of testing. The first was a Facebook group, the second was a Wordpress site using plugins, and this third iteration is the first version coded from scratch which includes some of the most basic custom functionality. So far, each of these tests has produced exciting results, and as we prepare to start testing this third iteration, I can't wait to see if other curious truth-seekers like myself will get as hyped as I am about having a tool to research and present information in this format.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to learn more or get involved. Email me at projectqrio@gmail.com


Cheers,
Stacia
